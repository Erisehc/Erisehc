- 👋 Hi, I’m @Erisehc
- 👀 I’m interested in biostatistics, machine learning and applied maths.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the above on the kaggle platform.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on kaggle games or MCM(actually I'm quite weak about these fields but making progress).
- 📫 How to reach me: you may send me email at lzd2021@mail.ustc.edu.cn.
